# To_Uber_Or_Not_To_Uber

Analyzed Uber data to see when is the best time to be a driver for Uber and when is the best time to be a passenger.  Created a multiplier to analyze when a driver would be paid the most and when a passenger would pay the leat. Multiplier ranged from 1-10. Higher the multipler, higher payment to driver. Lower multiplier, lower payment for passenger.
